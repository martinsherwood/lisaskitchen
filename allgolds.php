                    <p>Lisaâ€™s Kitchen is excited to be supporting the University of Gloucestershire All Golds by providing match day catering, food for fans and also a range of All Golds branded meals.</p>
                    
                    <p>The University of Gloucestershire has been at the forefront of developing Rugby League at a student level for nearly a decade. The semi-professional side plays in Championship 1, based at the Prince of Wales Stadium, Cheltenham.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>We are providing catering for both teams, officials and the board of directors. Meals are based around the local dishes from the area and use good quality ingredients.</p>
                    
                    <p>We aim to bring good quality food to rugby league fans on match days. For fans, we offer an exciting range of pies! Ham, leek and potato pies are a home baked favourite of supporters. The classic Cornish pasty is also available treating those from the North with a taste from the South.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ingredients are locally sourced, using local suppliers, growers and producers. We work closely with the University of Gloucestershire to provide employment for students and also work experience through internships from DegreePlus.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our range of All Golds meals can be purchased through the All Golds website at <a href="http://allgoldsrugby.com/temp-shop/" target="_blank">http://allgoldsrugby.com/temp-shop/</a>.</p>
