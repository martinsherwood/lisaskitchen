                        <p>Our mission is to <span class="mission">“provide students with healthy home cooked frozen ready meals.”</span> We use real ingredients and all the meals are cooked in the same way you would at home, nothing is factory produced either! We offer a variety of meals, and all contain at least 4 or 5 of your 5 a day.</p>

						<h2>How we began</h2>
                    	<p>In September 2012, Lisa started university at Gloucestershire studying Business Management. Pretty soon, Lisa realised that many people at the university, in halls and in houses didn’t cook dinner. This was either because they didn’t like cooking, the cost of meals were too expensive, time constraints or there was just no space for cooking. Time for a solution!</p>

                    <section>
                    	<h2>Now what?</h2>
						<p>There was a lot of research done, checking what students like, how they like it and perfecting recipes. We have tried to make the best meals for students, but we are open to suggestions for improvements and new meals to add to our line.</p>
                        <p>We hope you enjoy our website and products as much as we do, so have a look at our information on here, and then pop by and buy some of our meals!</p>
