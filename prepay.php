                    <h2>How it works</h2>
                    <p>Once we receive the money, we will contact the student and drop off the meal vouchers. These meal vouchers can be exchanged for meals! We can issue vouchers periodically if you would like too, rather than in one go. You can send payments through PayPal to info@lisaskitchen.co.uk and then leave a message on the payment screen with the following details:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your name</li>
                        <li>Your child’s name (who you want the meals to go to)</li>
                        <li>Number of meals purchased</li>
                        <li>Email address or student number of student</li>
                        <li>Postal address of student (to drop off the vouchers)</li>
                    </ul>
